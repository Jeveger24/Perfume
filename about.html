                <p>Vandulge is a home made perfume.</p>
                <P>I "Jeveger" wanted to try something new in my life.</P>
                <p>So, I created a perfume that is chemical-free.</p>
                <p>What that means is, it is a natural product where anyone can use.</p>
                <p>My products are mainly for women but I will also create perfume for men later on.</p>
                <p>We will also create perfumes that are totally different from other brands.</p>
